			LANGLEY, VAâ€”A report released Tuesday by the CIA's Office of the Inspector General revealed that the CIA has mistakenly obscured hundreds of thousands of pages of critical intelligence information with black highlighters.
			</p>
			</br>
			<p>
			According to the report, sections of the documentsâ€” "almost invariably the most crucial passages"â€”are marred by an indelible black ink that renders the lines impossible to read, due to a top-secret highlighting policy that began at the agency's inception in 1947.
			</p>
			</br>

			CIA Director <strong>Porter Goss</strong>lamented the fact that the public will probably never know the particulars of several historic events, such as: 
		<ul>
			<li>* the Cold War</li>
			<li>* the civil-rights movement </li>
			<li>* the growth of the international drug trade</li>
		</ul>
